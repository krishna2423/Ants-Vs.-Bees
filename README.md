In Ants vs. Bees, players defend their colony from waves of bees by strategically placing ants on a grid-like lawn. Each ant has unique abilities, such as attacking bees, producing resources, or creating barriers. Players collect food to grow more ants, balancing offense and defense to counter increasingly challenging bee types. Bees vary in speed, durability, and abilities, requiring careful planning to counter them effectively. The game introduces diverse settings, including daytime, nighttime, ponds, and tree branches, each adding unique mechanics. The gameplay emphasizes resource management, positioning, and adapting strategies as the bee waves become progressively tougher with each level.
